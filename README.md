# THESE ARE JUST SOME PYTHON EXCERSICES MADE IN VISUAL CODE
>[!NOTE]
>I have heard that there are better code editors to write your silly code, i just got VS Code because apparently everyone get its. <br>
>Besides that these are only my python excersices I might even leave some little notes here and there. Just to keep on track on what have I worked with because believe man I tend to forget things very easily. <br>

## **WHAT AMAZING STUFF WILL YOU SEE IN THIS MEDIOCRE .py FILES?**
1. Excersices to calculate a score
2. Variable and values
3. True and False
4. Even number or prime numbers (wow!!)
5. more stuff I will later add in [^1]

[^1]: psst perhaps I will make .hx scripts later or even one from Lua. I think I need to be less lazy because I really like coding. But it's the same as drawing. I barely do it.
